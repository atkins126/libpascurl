     * curl_slist_free_all to clean up an entire list.
     * Each single string should be written using the format
     * HOST:PORT:CONNECT-TO-HOST:CONNECT-TO-PORT where HOST is the host of the
     * request, PORT is the port of the request, CONNECT-TO-HOST is the host
     * name to connect to, and CONNECT-TO-PORT is the port to connect to.
     * The first string that matches the request's host and port is used.
     * Dotted numerical IP addresses are supported for HOST and CONNECT-TO-HOST.
     * A numerical IPv6 address must be written within [brackets].
     * Any of the four values may be empty. When the HOST or PORT is empty, the
     * host or port will always match (the request's host or port is ignored).
     * When CONNECT-TO-HOST or CONNECT-TO-PORT is empty, the "connect to"
     * feature will be disabled for the host or port, and the request's host or
     * port will be used to establish the network connection.
     * This option is suitable to direct the request at a specific server, e.g.
     * at a specific cluster node in a cluster of servers.
     * The "connect to" host and port are only used to establish the network
     * connection. They do NOT affect the host and port that are used for
     * TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or for the application
     * protocols.
     * In contrast to CURLOPT_RESOLVE, the option CURLOPT_CONNECT_TO does not
     * pre-populate the DNS cache and therefore it does not affect future
     * transfers of other easy handles that have been added to the same multi
     * handle.
     * The "connect to" host and port are ignored if they are equal to the host
     * and the port in the request URL, because connecting to the host and the
     * port in the request URL is the default behavior.
     * If an HTTP proxy is used for a request having a special "connect to" host
     * or port, and the "connect to" host or port differs from the request's
     * host and port, the HTTP proxy is automatically switched to tunnel mode
     * for this specific request. This is necessary because it is not possible
     * to connect to a specific host or port in normal (non-tunnel) mode.
     * When this option is passed to curl_easy_setopt, libcurl will not copy the
     * entire list so you must keep it around until you no longer use this
